Convert Controls to use Quaternions
Trial Textures
Automate Camera starting at map center - based on map size.
Move Camera position movement to callback.
Replace old sprintf_s code in frame rate updater
Add poly/vert count in title bar.
update debug/logger.
Clean up ChangeLOD().
Move (most of) ChangeLOD to QuadSphere.
	This requires moving the current position_array into QuadSphere
	A check in 3dRenderer will need to be added to check if the array has been changed
	If so, replace vbo.
Alternate Camera Modes.
